        the potatoes in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. Throw in the
        beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just
        tender but not too soft. Drain and put to one side.\r\nIn a wok or large frying
        pan, heat the oil until very hot, then drop in the garlic and cook until golden,
        this should take only a few seconds. Don\u2019t let it go very dark or it
        will spoil the taste. Spoon in the curry paste and stir it around for a few
        seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours. Next, pour
        in the coconut milk and let it come to a bubble.\r\nStir in the fish sauce
        and sugar, then the pieces of chicken. Turn the heat down to a simmer and
        cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.\r\nTip in
        the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk,
        then add a lovely citrussy flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves
        (or lime zest). The basil leaves go in next, but only leave them briefly on
        the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness. Scatter with the lime
        garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/sstssx1487349585.jpg","strTags":"Curry,Mild","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LIbKVpBQKJI","strIngredient1":"potatoes","strIngredient2":"green
