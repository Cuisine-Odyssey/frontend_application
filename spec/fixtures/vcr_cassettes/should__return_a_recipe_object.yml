        oven to 160C\/fan 140C\/gas 3. Line the base and sides of a 20 cm round, 7.5
        cm deep cake tin. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer for
        1-2 mins until very creamy and pale in colour, scraping down the sides of
        the bowl half way through. Stir in a spoonful of the flour, then stir in the
        beaten egg and the rest of the flour alternately, a quarter at a time, beating
        well each time with a wooden spoon. Stir in the almonds.\r\n\r\nMix in the
        sherry (the mix will look curdled), then add the peel, cherries, raisins,
        cherries, nuts, lemon zest, spice, rosewater and vanilla. Beat together to
        mix, then stir in the baking powder.\r\n\r\nSpoon mixture into the tin and
        smooth the top, making a slight dip in the centre. Bake for 30 mins, then
        lower temperature to 150C\/fan 130C\/gas 2 and bake a further 2-2\u00bc hrs,
        until a skewer insterted in the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the
        tin, then take out of the tin and peel off the lining paper. When completely
        cold, wrap well in cling film and foil to store until ready to decorate. The
        cake will keep for several months.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/ldnrm91576791881.jpg","strTags":"Christmas","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=34yeL8TstO0","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Muscovado
