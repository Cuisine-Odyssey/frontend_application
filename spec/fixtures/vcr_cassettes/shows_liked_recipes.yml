        cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nSnip a few small
        cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the
        grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness
        is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate
        in the oven.\r\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush
        and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper

        cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill
        plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nFor
        ''proper'' fried bread it''s best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use
        bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and
        cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side
        until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil.
        For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nFor

        leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash\/baste
        the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season
        and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked,

        the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings\/flames if it fits,
        and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\nCook the sausages first. Add
        the sausages to the hot grill plate\/the coolest part if there is one and
        allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until
        golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning
        to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely
        cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nSnip a few small
        cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the
        grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness
        is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate
        in the oven.\r\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush
        and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper
        and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate
        and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes.
        Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural
        juices, making them soggy.\r\nFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the
        centre\/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp
        knife remove the green ''eye''. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with
        a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without
        moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further
        2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\r\nFor the black pudding,
        cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill
        plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nFor
        ''proper'' fried bread it''s best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use
        bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and
        cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side
        until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil.
        For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nFor
        the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and
        leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash\/baste
        the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season
        and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked,
        serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato
        ketchup or brown sauce.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/sqrtwu1511721265.jpg","strTags":"Greasy,UnHealthy,HangoverFood,Calorific,Breakfast,BBQ","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FXjYU2Ensck","strIngredient1":"Sausages","strIngredient2":"Bacon","strIngredient3":"Mushrooms","strIngredient4":"Tomatoes","strIngredient5":"Black
