        in a small bowl with the vinegar and set aside to pickle. Put the avocado
        in another bowl and mash with a fork, leaving some larger chunks. Stir in
        the lime juice and season well. Mix the soured cream with the harissa and
        set aside until ready to serve.\r\n\r\nHeat a griddle pan until nearly smoking.
        Add the tortillas , one at a time, charring each side until hot with griddle
        lines. \r\n\r\nPut everything on the table and build the fajitas : spread
        a little of the harissa cream over the tortilla, top with roasted chickpeas,
