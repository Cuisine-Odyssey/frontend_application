        Servings\r\n\r\n1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.
        Cut potatoes into 1\/2-inch-thick wedges. Toss on one side of a baking sheet
        with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potatoes
        out across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (we''ll add the
        broccoli then). \r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile, cut broccoli florets into bite-size
        pieces, if necessary. Peel and finely chop garlic. In a small microwave-safe
        bowl, combine 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and half the garlic.
        Microwave until garlic sizzles, 30 seconds. \r\n\r\n3. Once potatoes have
        roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven and add broccoli to empty side;
        carefully toss with garlic oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, add broccoli
        to a second sheet.) Continue roasting until potatoes and broccoli are browned
        and crispy, 15-20 minutes more. \r\n\r\n4. While veggies roast, pat chicken
        dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle
        of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned
        and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. (If chicken browns too quickly,
        reduce heat to medium.) Turn off heat; set chicken aside to rest. Wash out
        pan. \r\n\r\n5. Heat pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle
        of oil and remaining garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in vinegar,
        honey, stock concentrate, and 1\/4 cup water (1\/3 cup for 4 servings). Simmer
        until thick and glossy, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter
        (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper. \r\n\r\n6. Return chicken to
        pan and turn to coat in glaze. Divide chicken, broccoli, and potatoes between
        plates. Spoon any remaining glaze over chicken and serve. ","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/kvbotn1581012881.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"","strIngredient1":"Potatoes","strIngredient2":"Broccoli","strIngredient3":"Garlic","strIngredient4":"Chicken

        oven to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square
        tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips
        over the base). To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground
        almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl.
        Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape
        into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins \u2013 when
        you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins,
        then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\r\nFor
        the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as
        above, but don\u2019t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring.
        Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\r\nTo assemble,
        heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite
        edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure
        the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler
        to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard
        or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\r\nTake 2 x almond slices
        and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one
        marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm
        wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick.
        Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at
        one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving
        4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then
        sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard
        effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\r\nCarefully lift up
        the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan
        fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite
        side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or,
        more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using
        the prongs of a fork.\r\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight
        box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to
        a month.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/ywwrsp1511720277.jpg","strTags":"Cake,Sweet","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aB41Q7kDZQ0","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Caster

        with fennel sausage sauce","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Lamb","strArea":"Moroccan","strInstructions":"Heat
        a tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Add the
        sausage pieces and fry on a medium-high heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly,
        until golden-brown all over. Transfer the sausages to a plate, then add the
        onion and fennel to the hot pan and fry for 15 minutes, stirring once in a
        while, until soft and caramelised; if the pan goes a bit dry, add a teaspoon
        or so of extra oil. Stir in the paprika, garlic and half the fennel seeds,
        fry for two minutes more, then pour on the wine and boil for 30 seconds, to
        reduce by half. Add the tomatoes, sugar, 100ml water, the seared sausage and
        half a teaspoon of salt, cover and simmer for 30 minutes; remove the lid after
        10 minutes, and cook until the sauce is thick and rich. Remove from the heat,
        stir through the olives and remaining fennel seeds and set aside until you\u2019re
        ready to serve.\r\n\r\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the
        pasta and cook for 12-14 minutes (or according to the instructions on the
        packet), until al dente. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Drain the pasta, return
        it to the pot, stir in a tablespoon of oil, then divide between the bowls.
        \r\n\r\nPut all the pesto ingredients except the basil in the small bowl of
        a food processor. Add a tablespoon of water and blitz to a rough paste. Add
        the basil, then blitz until just combined (the pesto has a much better texture
        if the basil is not overblended).\r\n\r\nSpoon over the rag\u00f9 and top
        with a spoonful of pesto. Finish with a sprinkling of chopped fennel fronds,
        if you have any, and serve at once.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/qtqvys1468573168.jpg","strTags":"Pasta","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=45dpOfESxr8","strIngredient1":"olive
