        the pears, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. If you like, they can
        be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they
        dry out.\r\nTip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into
        an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until
        bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and
        the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour.\r\nLay the pears in the pan, then
        cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised.
        Don\u2019t worry about them burning \u2013 they won\u2019t \u2013 but you
        want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let
        it flamb\u00e9, then set the pears aside.\r\nHeat oven to 200C\/fan 180C\/gas
        6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Using a plate slightly
        larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of
        the circle of pastry to thin them out.\r\nWhen the pears have cooled slightly,
        arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around
        the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre,
        with the cardamom pods scattered around.\r\nDrape the pastry over the pears,
        then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon\u2019s
        guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. If a lot of
        juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide).
        Reduce oven to 180C\/fan 160C\/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry
        is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto
        a serving dish.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/rxvxrr1511797671.jpg","strTags":"Tart,Glazed,Baking","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8U1tKWKDeWA","strIngredient1":"Pears","strIngredient2":"Caster
