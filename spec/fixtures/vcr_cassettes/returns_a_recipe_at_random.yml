        a small pinch of salt and sesame oil to minced beef. Mix well and set aside.\r\nMix
        1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 and \u00bd tablespoons of water in a small
        bowl to make water starch.\r\nCut tofu into square cubes (around 2cms). Bring
        a large amount of water to a boil and then add a pinch of salt. Slide the
        tofu in and cook for 1 minute. Move out and drain.\r\nGet a wok and heat up
        around 2 tablespoons of oil, fry the minced meat until crispy. Transfer out
        beef out and leave the oil in.\r\nFry doubanjiang for 1 minute over slow fire
        and then add garlic, scallion white, ginger and fermented black beans to cook

        and then pour the other half. You can slightly taste the tofu and add pinch
        of salt if not salty enough. By the way, if you feel it is too spicy, add
        some sugar can milder the taste. But be carefully as the broth is very hot
        at this point.\r\nTransfer out when almost all the seasonings stick to tofu
