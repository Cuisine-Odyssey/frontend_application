        the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and rub in the cubed butter until
        the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then mix in the dried fruit.\r\nIn a clean
        bowl, beat the egg and milk together with the vanilla extract.\r\nAdd the
        egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture
        just comes together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you
        really need it to make the mixture stick together.\r\nPlace golfball-sized
        spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking tray. Leave space between them
        as they will flatten and spread out to double their size during baking.\r\nBake
        for 15-20 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven, allow to cool
        for a couple of minutes then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/tqrrsq1511723764.jpg","strTags":"Baking,Cake","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tY3taZO3Aro","strIngredient1":"Self-raising
