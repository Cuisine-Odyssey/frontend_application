        make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along
        with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a pur\u00e9e. If you\u2019re having trouble
        getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture,
        and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up \u2013 don\u2019t be
        tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.\r\n\r\nTaste the jerk mixture
        for seasoning \u2013 it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering
        salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it\u2019s not spicy enough for
        you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar
        until the mixture tastes well balanced.\r\n\r\nMake a few slashes in the chicken
        thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices.
        Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to
        barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you\u2019re
        ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think
        of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience,
        add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect
        heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4. Put
        the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45
        mins until tender and cooked through.\r\n\r\nWhile the chicken is cooking,
        prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip
        it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney
        beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once
        the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for
        10 mins.\r\n\r\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off
        the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted
        lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if
        you like it really spicy.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/tytyxu1515363282.jpg","strTags":"Chilli,Curry","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qfchrS2D_v4","strIngredient1":"Chicken
