        make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in
        the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs
        (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons
        of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the
        fridge for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 and
        put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from
        the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry
        out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin
        with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up
        during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film
        and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge
        (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at
        this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will
        drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently
        in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon
        juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less
        citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour
        the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the
        reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide.
        Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash
        the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice
        pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
        the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
        down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
        tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to
        colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. If at this
        stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with
        tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown
        and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up
        in the tin. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wprvrw1511641295.jpg","strTags":"Tart","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI","strIngredient1":"Plain
