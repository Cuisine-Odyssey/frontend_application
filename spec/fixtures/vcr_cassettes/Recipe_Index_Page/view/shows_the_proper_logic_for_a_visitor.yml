        oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, peel, and cut carrots
        on a diagonal into \u00bc-inch-thick pieces. Dice potatoes into \u00bd-inch
        pieces. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nToss carrots
        on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast until browned
        and tender, 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, place potatoes in a
        medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil
        and cook until tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to pot; cover
        to keep warm.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWhile potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of oil in
        a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally,
        until lightly browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. Sprinkle with 1 tsp sugar
        (2 tsp for 4 servings). Stir in stock concentrate and 2 TBSP water (\u00bc
        cup for 4); season with salt and pepper. Cook until jammy, 2-3 minutes more.
        Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. Wash out pan.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nPat
        chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat
        a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Add chicken
        and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. In the last
        1-2 minutes of cooking, top with caramelized onion and cheese. Cover pan until
        cheese melts. (If your pan doesn\u2019t have a lid, cover with a baking sheet!)\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nHeat
        pot with drained potatoes over low heat; mash with sour cream, 2 TBSP butter
        (4 TBSP for 4 servings), salt, pepper, and a splash of water (or milk, for
        extra richness) until smooth. Divide chicken, roasted carrots, and mashed
        potatoes between plates.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/b5ft861583188991.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"","strIngredient1":"Chicken
