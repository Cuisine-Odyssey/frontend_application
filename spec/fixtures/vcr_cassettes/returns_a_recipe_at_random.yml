        water for about 5-10 minutes or until finish with prep.\r\nProceed to slicing
        the onions, mincing the garlic and dicing the tomatoes. Set aside\r\nRemove
        kale from water cut in chunks.\r\nPlace bacon on saucepan and cook until crispy.
        Then add onions, garlic, thyme, stir for about a minute or more\r\nAdd tomatoes;
        scotch bonnet pepper, smoked paprika. Saut\u00e9 for about 2-3 more minutes.\r\nFinally
        add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about 6-8 minutes or until
        leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and
        turn off the heat.\r\nUsing a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain.
        This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line
        down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove
        plantain peel by pulling it back.\r\nSlice the plantain into medium size lengthwise

        the tops of the plantains with a generous layer of oil spray and sprinkle
        with salt, freshly ground pepper.\r\nLet the plantains \"fry\" on medium heat,
        shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes.\r\nAs the plantains
        brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper (if needed)
