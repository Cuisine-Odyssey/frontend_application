        the uncooked pork thinly, about \u215b\". It helps to slightly freeze it (optional).\r\nMince
        garlic and shallots. Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce,
        pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves.\r\nMarinate the meat for 1 hour, or
        overnight for better results.\r\nBake the pork at 375F for 10-15 minutes or
        until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice
        golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway.\r\nAssemble your
        bowl with veggies, noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up
        and pour the fish sauce on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce
        it slowly.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/qqwypw1504642429.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q3qcQcENzbU","strIngredient1":"Pork","strIngredient2":"Rice
